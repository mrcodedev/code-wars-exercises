// Sum all the numbers of the array (in F# and Haskell you get a list) except the highest and the lowest element (the value, not the index!).
// (The highest/lowest element is respectively only one element at each edge, even if there are more than one with the same value!)

// Example:

// { 6, 2, 1, 8, 10 } => 16
// { 1, 1, 11, 2, 3 } => 6

// If array is empty, null or None, or if only 1 Element exists, return 0.
// Note:In C++ instead null an empty vector is used. In C there is no null. ;-)


// -- There's no null in Haskell, therefore Maybe [Int] is used. Nothing represents null.
// Have fun coding it and please don't forget to vote and rank this kata! :-)

// I have created other katas. Have a look if you like coding and challenges.
